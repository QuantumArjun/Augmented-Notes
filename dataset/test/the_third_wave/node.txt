##Culture Arguments for and Against Democracy

[[Is Democracy a Universal Value]]

Restrictive version - Only Western-culture provides a suitable base for the development of democratic institutions 
- Advanced by George Kennan, who said, "Democracy consequently has a 'relatively narrow base both in time and in space; and the evidence has yet to be produced that is is the natural form of rule for peoples outside those narrow perimeters'"
- Argument
	- Democracy originated in the West
	- Most Democratic countries have been Western countries 
	- Outside NA, most have been former British colonies, or countries with heavy American influence 
	- Eastern Europe and Soviet a good example of a dividing line (drawn by religous border in the 1500s) 


Less Restrictive version - Certain cultures are against Democracy

- [[Asian Values]]
	- Emphasizes the group over the individual, authority over liberty, and responsibilities over rights 
	- Maintanence of order and respect for hierarchy are central values
	- Conflict of ideas, groups, and parties was viewed as dangerous and illegitimate 
		- "Adversarial politics is particularly out of place in a multiracial society like Singapore" - Lee Kwan Yu 
		- "in the Korean religious tradition, negotiation and compromise are not recognized as a social norm, but as selling out"
	- ‘To think that power may be corrupt and requires institutional check and balance is a contradiction in terms”


Even when Democracy did spread to places like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, it came through a Dominant Party
- KMT in Taiwan, LDP in Japan, DPK in South Korea 
	- Maintin first criterion though - other parties are more than welcome to contest 
- But, no alternation between countries (like in a Barometer for Africa)
	- Leads to a structural problem - if system fails, people will blame the system rather than the political party, as they cannot oust the political party 
		- This is not true though - many of these parties in these example countries have been ousted


[[Islamic Values]]
- Principles for Democracy
	- Egalitarianism
		- But what about for women? 
	- Voluntarism 
- Principles against Democracy
	- Rejects any distinction between religous community and political community 
	- Sharia should be basic law, and Ulama should have a 'decisive vote in articulating, or at least reviewing and ratifying, all governmental policy '
- Almost all authoritiarian
	- Liberalization usually just brought more hardliners into power 

Against Cultural Arguments
- [[Max Weber]] - Catholic countries unlikely to develop economically like Protestant countries
