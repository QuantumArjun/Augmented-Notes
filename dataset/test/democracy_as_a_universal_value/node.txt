Biggest Development of the 20th Century - the Rise of Democracy (namely as a Universal Value)

[[Is Democracy a Universal Value]]

[[Democracy vs Development]]
- Amartya Sen says Democracy; "A country does not have to be deemed fit for Democracy; rather, it has to become fit through democracy"


[[India's Democracy]] a great example of how Democracy can come from nothing and be cultivated outside of the West
- Also a great example of how regional diversoty in terms of languge, religion, etc can be overcome 


Argument (again around [[Democracy vs Development]]) - Non-Democratic Countries lead to better Economic Development
- Singapore often cited as an example of authoritarian Economic Development; Examples of the contrary (namely Botswanna)
- There seems to be no correlation between economic development and political freedom (from Przeworski et. al, Sustainable Democracy and Barro, Getting it Right)
	- Namely because the things that lead to #economic_development (openness to competition, international markets, high education, land reforms, etc) don't require an authoritarian government 
- There have also never been famines in an electoral democracy (More accountability to the people)

3 Functions of [[Democracy]]
- Instrinsic Value associated with political and social participation 
	- The lack of those is political and social deprivation 
	- Suppression of one leads to the suppresion of the other [[Tocqueville#^fa31b0]]
- Instrumental Important
	- Enhances the hearing that people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political attention 
- Constructive Importance
	- Democracy leads to things like open debate, criticism, and generative ideas; Crucial to formation of values and priorities


What is a Universal Value?
- "The claim of a universal value is that people anywhere may have reason to see it as valuable"
- Examplse include Gandhi's Non-Violence and Tagore's "Freedom of the mind"

Argument #1 - Those who are poor care about bread, not Democracy
- Protective value of Democracy may be particularly important for the poor
- Poor people prefer to reject Democracy ^35264d
	- Emergency, and the Barometers


Argument #2 - Cultural Differences
- Western writing has its fair share of authoritarian writings, from Plato's [[Philosopher Kings ]] to Aquinas and the idea of [[Catholic Integralism]] to Machiavelli and the influence of [[The Prince]]
- [[Asian Values]]
	- Confucius not the only philosophical influence on these regions; Buddhism, Shintoism, Christianity, etc have also had an impact
		- Buddhism can actually be seen as pro-Democracy [[Buddhism and Democracy]]
		- Confucian values themselves don't completely eschew Democracy, as it doesn't advocate for blind allegiance to the state 
- [[Islamic Values]]
